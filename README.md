# CS488-Final-Project
This is the final project for the Introduction to Graphics course (CS 488) offered by the University of Waterloo

To compile this program you can just run the make file provided
to ensure using the latest make file that includes all source files you should run premake4 gmake before compiling
however, I have kept the makefile up to date so far
so to compile just run make all

to run the program do the following
cd Assets
../A4 <lua scene file>

For this project I have built a ray tracer that supports the following features
Primitives including spheres, cubes, cylinders and cones
Reflection and refraction
glossy reflection
glossy refraction
soft shadows with area lights
texture mapping
bump mapping
texture generation using perlin noise (wood)
animation
